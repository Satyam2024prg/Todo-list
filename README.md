âœ… Console-Based To-Do List Manager (C++)
A lightweight, menu-driven task management application built entirely in C++, designed for efficient task tracking directly from the terminal. This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming, file I/O, and user interaction in a console environment.

ðŸ’¼ Features:
Task Management: Add, view, complete, and delete tasks from a persistent to-do list.

Persistent Storage: All tasks are saved to and loaded from a local file (tasks.txt), allowing session continuity.

Clear CLI Interface: Interactive command-line interface with user prompts and real-time feedback.

Object-Oriented Design: Implemented using Task and ToDoList classes to maintain clean and modular code structure.

Error Handling: Handles invalid inputs gracefully with user-friendly messages.

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose:
This project showcases my ability to implement a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using core C++ principles, emphasizing clean code practices and practical utility.

ðŸ§ª Platforms:
Executable: Runs on Windows (.exe provided)

Source Code: Easily portable to Linux/macOS with a C++ compiler (like g++)
